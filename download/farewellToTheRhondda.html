				<P>Tommy Sands and Pete Seeger with The Music of Healing. And Pete’s shaky yet still powerful voice, so effective, isn’t it? In fact, in some ways, because of its fragility, it is even more effective. I love that song, I love that family: The Sands. Greetings across the waters my friends, from us here in BBC Radio Wales, may Ireland have a peaceful Christmas.</P>
				<P>The Sands Family spent a lot of time in Germany, even though they’re massively popular over there, they toured in the 1970s to—almost standstill. They were—they were there for months on end, I seem to remember, and I know that the family still tour to this day.</P>
				<P>There’s a big market for folk music in Germany, and—one of my songs found its way over there; I was at a rather sad occasion, I was at the funeral of a friend not so long ago, and one of the members of a German folk band called Among Friends was at the funeral, and her name is Trude Johannessen. And afterwards we were talking about folk music and we were discussing how songs travelled and how people picked up a song and saw something in it that they related to and then they learned it and passed it on to somebody else, and that's the oral tradition of course. <B>[…]</B><!--Yeah, uh, since time and memorial? that such? songs have travelled.</B>???--></P>
				I never thought one of the songs I’ve written would travel in that way. Certainly to Germany, where apparently it is a very popular folk song. And this lady, Trude, said: ‘We’ve recorded it ourselves. I’m not sure about the Welsh pronounciation of the place names, but we’ve made a go of it and I hope maybe one day you’ll get a chance to listen to it.’</P>
				<P>Well, I have heard it, I have the album here, Triple Distilled it's called, hehe, yeah, back on the booze, and this is Among Friends from Germany, a version of Farewell to the Rhonnda, and if the place names are not absolutely perfect, I think it's 10 out of 10 for the effort. Well done. Lovely to meet you Trude, and maybe when next we meet, it’ll be under happier circumstances.</P>

			<P>Dankeschön, my friends, thank you. There we have—Among Friends is the name of the band, Triple Distilled is the name of the album, and that was Farewell to the Rhondda as you probably never heard it before. But—it’s one of the nicest things that’s ever happened to me.</P>
			<P>A similar thing happened when a man, a very, very famous french balladier called Renaud recorded an album of Irish songs and Farewell to the Rhondda was included, but in French! Adieu à Rhondda, and it went to number one in the week it was released. So the Rhondda has done this Cardiff bred proud. Thanks to all those in the Rhondda and to everybody everywhere else who’s recorded that song in whatever form.</P>
			<P>I'll play you something from Renaud's album, Balade irlandaise. I won't play you Adieu à Rhondda or any more of my songs because, well—modesty prevents.</P>
